This project is mainly for recording the deployment of a simple web application on AWS.
## For tweets rumor detection
This is under 'NLP' section. Except for tweet rumor detection, we have present the tweet texts from the embeded code of tweets, sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction. The models are from AWS Sagemakers and Microsoft Azure. Besides, we have just trained a bert model for tweet rumor detection and have a precision of 84% on [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) without fine-tuning the parameters. The training and prediction file are on the BERT folder which you could train yourself a better model. Our trained model is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NlNkaEHokLfyps-LHfiRhVTOy9qK8ErO/view?usp=sharing)
## For face beauty prediction
For FBP, we are using the [trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJa2CcBoiHPTRQww9V7eO4Mu-Ey6LOEf/view?usp=sharing). The GUI file is an example for how I use that model and make predictions which is just for reference.
